# yategood-manager

A simple batch script to manage the YateGood service.

This project aims to centralize the tools in configuring the Yategood Push-to-talk to Cellular (PoC) radios without tinkering too much ADBs.

This program focuses on the Zello application, but revisions for other applications are welcome.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 
- [Android Platform Tools (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) 
- ...and of course, a Yategood PoC radio.

## Usage

- Please download the latest release of the zip file here:

- Extract the zip file inside the **üìÅplatform-tools** folder
- Open **yategood-manager.bat**

## Available Options

The batch script provides the following interactive menu options:

1. **CHECK IF ADB IS WORKING**
   - Verifies if Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is installed and accessible. Lists connected devices if successful, or shows an error if ADB is not recognized.

2. **INSTALL APKS FROM "APP" FOLDER**
   - Installs all APK files found in the `app` directory (included in the zip file) to the connected device using ADB.
   
   **KNOWN BUG:** The script will terminate after running this option, so it needs to be opened once again after installing. A fix is still ongoing.

3. **SEND TEXT INPUT TO ZELLO**
   - Prompts the user to enter text, which is then sent to the Zello app on the device using ADB. Spaces in the input are replaced with underscores. The user should manually place the cursor in the desired field in Zello before running this option.

4. **AUTO-FILL ZELLO LOGIN**
   - Guides the user to the Zello login screen, then prompts for username, password, and network. Automatically fills these fields in the app using ADB commands and attempts to log in. Spaces are replaced with underscores.

5. **EXIT**
   - Exits the script.
